    "# Vectors\n",
    "The set Rn is the set of all n-tuples of real numbers. In set notation this is Rn={(x1,x2,x3,⋯,xn):x1,x2,x3,⋯,xn∈R}. For example, the set R3 represents the set of real triples, (x,y,z) coordinates, in three-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "A vector in Rn is an n-tuple, or point, in Rn. Vectors can be written horizontally (i.e., with the elements of the vector next to each other) in a row vector, or vertically (i.e., with the elements of the vector on top of each other) in a column vector. If the context of a vector is ambiguous, it usually means the vector is a column vector. The i-th element of a vector, v, is denoted by vi. The transpose of a column vector is a row vector of the same length, and the transpose of a row vector is a column vector. In mathematics, the transpose is denoted by a superscript T, or vT. The zero vector is the vector in Rn containing all zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "The norm of a vector is a measure of its length. There are many ways of defining the length of a vector depending on the metric used (i.e., the distance formula chosen). The most common is called the L2 norm, which is computed according to the distance formula you are probably familiar with from grade school. The L2 norm of a vector v is denoted by ∥v∥2 and ∥v∥2=∑iv2i−−−−−√. This is sometimes also called Euclidian length and refers to the “physical” length of a vector in one-, two-, or three-dimensional space. The L1 norm, or “Manhattan Distance,” is computed as ∥v∥1=∑i|vi|, and is named after the grid-like road structure in New York City. In general, the p-norm, Lp, of a vector is ∥v∥p=(∑ivpi)−−−−−−√p. The L∞ norm is the p-norm, where p=∞. The L∞ norm is written as ||v||∞ and it is equal to the maximum absolute value in v."

    "A matrix that is close to being singular (i.e., the determinant is close to 0) is called ill-conditioned. Although ill-conditioned matrices have inverses, they are problematic numerically in the same way that dividing a number by a very, very small number is problematic. That is, it can result in computations that result in overflow, underflow, or numbers small enough to result in significant round-off errors (If you forget these concepts, refresh yourself with materials in chapter 9). The condition number is a measure of how ill-conditioned a matrix is, and it can be computed using Numpy’s function cond from linalg. The higher the condition number, the closer the matrix is to being singular.\n",

It can be shown that the number of linearly independent rows is always equal to the number of linearly independent columns for any matrix. A matrix is called full rank. if rank (A)=min(m,n). The matrix, A, is also full rank if all of its columns are linearly independent. An augmented matrix. is a matrix, A, concatenated with a vector, y, and is written [A,y]. This is commonly read “A augmented with y.” You can use np.concatenate to concatenate the them. If rank([A,y])=rank(A)+1, then the vector, y, is “new” information. That is, it cannot be created as a linear combination of the columns in A. The rank is an important property of matrices because of its relationship to solutions of linear equations, which is discussed in the last section of this chapter."
